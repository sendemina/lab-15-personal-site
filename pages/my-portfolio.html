      This is my first semester in college and I'm studying Emerging Media Technology at City Tech.
      I know some C# and I've made a few little projects in Unity game engine.
      My dream job is to be a video game developer or a 3D animator. In 5 years, I see myself
      with a completed bachelor's degree and hopefully employed in some game studio.
