      My name is Sen and I'm from Russia. Some of my hobbies include making pixel art and
      learning languages, including programming ones. I also write silly poems sometimes.
      In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy books and playing video games.
      <br>
      <br>
      There are a lot of things I want to be good at, for example composing music and
      playing video games on hard difficulty, but I guess nobody's perfect.

      This is my first semester in college and I'm studying Emerging Media Technology at City Tech.
      I know some C# and I've made a few little projects in Unity game engine.
      <br>
      <br>
      My dream job is to be a video game developer or a 3D animator. In 5 years, I see myself
      with a completed bachelor's degree and hopefully working in some game studio.
