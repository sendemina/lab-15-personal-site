      My name is Sen and I'm from Russia. Some of my hobbies include making art and
      learning languages, including programming ones. I also write silly poems sometimes.
      In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy books and playing video games.
      <br>
      There are a lot of things I want to be good at, for example composing music and
      playing video games on hard difficulty, but I guess nobody's perfect.
